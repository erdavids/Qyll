In simplest form, Qyll lets you write without seeing what you have already written.

You can only export your text once you reach your word count goal.

That's it. [Try it out!](../page)

The next question would be "Why is Qyll?"

Qyll is just another tool in the fight against perfectionism. It is designed to help people write instead of getting stuck editing what they have barely written.

# Note

Qyll is currently in early development and will eventually have more features designed to help writers reach their goals.

The core functionality will be 100% free forever.
